# PennyLane Codebook Solutions

This repository contains solutions and explanations for selected exercises from the ([PennyLane Codebook](https://pennylane.ai/codebook)), a hands-on resource for learning quantum computing with PennyLane.

The goal is to provide clear, well-documented code and reasoning to help learners better understand quantum concepts and how to implement them using PennyLane.

## Who Is This For?

This repository is intended for:

- 🧑‍🎓 Students and researchers learning quantum computing
- 🧑‍💻 Developers interested in quantum programming with PennyLane
- 🔍 Self-learners looking for reference solutions to deepen their understanding

## Next Release (Mid August, 2025) 
- Complete all Introduction part
- Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA)
- Basic Quantum Algorithms (BA)
